## Project Overview

**Code Review Buddy** is an intelligent web application that provides automated code reviews using large language models (LLMs). It analyzes your code snippets across multiple dimensions and delivers expert-level feedback instantly. 

**Key Highlights:**
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages OpenAI/Gemini-level models for deep code understanding
- 🎨 **Beautiful Glass UI**: Modern glass morphism interface with interactive elements
- 📊 **Multi-Parameter Reviews**: Evaluates code on style, performance, security, and best practices
- 🗃️ **Review History**: Automatically saves all reviews in a local SQLite database

**Disclaimer**: This project was developed through **prompt engineering** - all code was generated by LLMs based on carefully crafted prompts, then assembled into this application.
